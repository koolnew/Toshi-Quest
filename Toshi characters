Santa's vanishing. 

The core of this story: 
 Santa mysteriously disappeared.  Santa's reflections, called Toshi for short, were called from parallel worlds throughout the Metaverse, and united in the digital world of web3 to ensure the continuation of the beloved tradition of giving gifts and the balance of forces of good in the world.

Although each Toshi lacks the original Santa's magic, they possess unique abilities and skills that set them apart from one another. United in their mission, the 2023 Santoshi Bullrunners tirelessly collaborate to keep the spirit of generosity, laughter, and support alive while searching for the real Santa.

"When Santa Claus mysteriously disappears, a unique Toshi is summoned into our world. Yet, instead of arriving in the real world, he finds himself plunged into the enigmatic world of the Internet. His mission is a daunting one: Unravel the mystery of Santa's disappearance to save the Christmas holiday. 

As Toshi navigates through the vast, interconnected landscape of cyberspace, he deciphers riddle after riddle, each leading him closer to his goal. Along his journey, he discovers other summoned Toshis, each from a different world, each endowed with a power akin to Santa's. 

With Christmas at stake, these Toshis must unite, leverage their quirky powers, and overcome a series of hilarious digital mishaps. The question remains, can this motley crew of Toshis crack the code, solve the mystery, and restore Santa in time for Christmas?

This engaging narrative combines the allure of a thrilling mystery, the humor of a comedy, and the magic of a Christmas tale."
